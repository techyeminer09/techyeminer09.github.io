        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is <strong>techyeminer09</strong>. I am a high school student based on Earth. I have a passion for gaming, 3D design, and coding.</p>
        <p>I currently own 3 devices: a Samsung A13 running Android, a 2013 MacBook Air running Windows 10 Pro for workstations, and a Dell Optiplex 9020 running Windows 10 Pro.</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>My most used device is probably my MacBook as I use it at school. My school prefers students to use macOS for security reasons. However, the school has a restrictive software called Jamf installed on Macs, which can monitor or even start a local server on your computer. Due to this, I switched to using Fedora 38 for a while, but unfortunately, the school doesn't have Linux WIFI certificates, so I couldn't use the school WIFI. Since Mac and Windows don't require certificates and there's an exploit on the redirect site to bypass certificate installation, I am currently running Windows 10 natively. I also can't use macOS anymore due to the 32-bit support drop, which means I can't play Portal or Half-Life.</p>
