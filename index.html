        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is <strong>techyeminer09</strong>. I am a high school student based in Western Australia. I have a passion for gaming, 3D design, and coding.</p>
        <p>I currently own 3 devices, a Samsung A13 running android, A 2013 MacBook Air Running Windows 10 Pro for workstations, and a Dell Optiplex 9020 running Windows 10 Pro</p>

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>My most used device is probably my MacBook as I use it at school. My school prefers students to use MacOS for security reasons. But although MacOS is a pretty good OS, they get you to install 3rd party software called Jamf. This software is very restrictive and can monitor or even start a local server on your computer. So then I started to use Fedora 38 for a while until I found out the school doesn't have Linux WIFI certificates, so I could not use the school WIFI. Although you don't need a certificate on MacOS or Windows as there is an exploit that exists in the redirect site to try and get you to install the certificate where you can just keep pressing "I think I have received this message in error." until it gives you access. So that's why I am now running Windows 10 natively. And I am not running MacOS because of the whole 32-bit support drop, so I can't play Portal or Half-Life:(</p>
